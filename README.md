### Spring boot with JSF and primefaces to reproduce form feed ajax issues:

Run with `mvn spring-boot:run` and then check [localhost:8080/home.xhtml](localhost:8080/home.xhtml)

Click the 'click me' button and view the response in developer tools

I repurposed the project https://github.com/hjander/spring-boot-jsf-primefaces-example to create this demo project
